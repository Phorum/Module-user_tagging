Changelog:
----------

2010-06-19 v1.0.7

    - Implemented ban list checking as a user matching criterium. Thanks
		  to Phil Connolly for the idea and for writing up the patch.

2009-10-21 v1.0.6

    - Updated the module to be compatible with the new CSRF protection
      features in Phorum 5.2.

2008-10-17 v1.0.5

    - Always show the group criterium, so we can show users that there
      is such option available. Thanks to Ulf Dunkel for the suggestion.

2008-08-09 v1.0.4

    - Fixed the greater-than-or-equal comparisons. They were implemented
      as greater-then in the code.

2008-07-31 v1.0.3

    - Added an option for tagging the authors and recent authors that
      are shown on the message list pages.

2008-06-11 v1.0.2

    - Moved the tagging for the active Phorum user to the
      common_post_user hook. This way, the template variables
      can be setup early enough to give other modules access
      to them.

    - Added a new user matching option, to match users by their group.

    - Improved some wordings on the settings page to make the
      options easier to understand.

2008-02-05 v1.0.1

    - Removed some stale code which resulted in undefined index warnings
      on the read page.

2008-02-03 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
